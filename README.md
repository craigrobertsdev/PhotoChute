## Work Description

For this Project we utilised Express.js, GraphQL, Stripe, Mongoose, React, MongoDB, BootStrap, Apollo Client and Azure to create a functional react website that separates front end and back end functionality.The photos are stored in Azure blob storage and thumbnails are created automatically via a serverless function that is triggered each time a photo is uploaded. The styling is predominantly done with React-Bootstrap and JSX was created by uploading Figma to Quest AI.

For this project we separated the jobs into front end, back end and additional features, By doing this we alleviated the possibility of merge conflicts and repetition of code. Throughout the project we were able to avoid any major issues, Issues we did face were minor issues that were easily resolved with some trial and error. The biggest challenge we faced was lack of knowledge of the technologies we were using, a lot of time was spent learning and developing our skills with the used technologies to create what we envisaged for the project.

Our major success was our communication and planning we started this project with a good idea in mind of what the final product will look and function like which helped all of us achieve our goal faster and without issues.
